Caesar Cipher Breaker - Documentation

	This C++ project is developed to break Caesar cipher-encrypted texts using frequency analysis. It uses different distance metrics (Chi-Squared, Euclidean, and Cosine) to compare the frequency histogram of the cipher text to the known English letter frequency distribution. A menu-driven console interface is provided for ease of use.

Features
1.	Read Letter Distribution: Reads letter frequency distribution from a file named 'distribution.txt'.
2.	Compute Histogram: Computes the frequency histogram of a given input text.
3.	Chi-Squared Distance Calculation: Calculates the Chi-Squared distance between the text's histogram and the standard English distribution.
4.	Euclidean Distance Calculation: Computes the Euclidean distance between the text's histogram and the English distribution.
5.	Cosine Distance Calculation: Calculates the Cosine distance metric for the same comparison.
6.	Break Caesar Cipher: Attempts all possible Caesar cipher shifts and evaluates them based on the selected distance metric to identify the most likely original message.
